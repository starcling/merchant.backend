# PumaPay Merchant Backend

The v2.0 of the PumaPay PullPayment protocol on the merchant side consists of a set of APIs that the merchant can use to connect to the
rest of the PumaPay ecosystem. All the relevant core functionality is provided by the PumaPay merchant SDK.

## Components
### NodeJS
The NodeJS server uses the merchant SDK as a singleton and provides a list of API methods that are used to specify their own billing models,
to register the PullPayments of their customers as well as executing and monitoring the blockchain transactions related with the PullPayments.
### PostgreSQL DB
The PostgreSQL database stores the billing models, the PullPayments and the Ethereum transactions.
### MySQL DB
MySQL database is an encrypted database used for encrypting the HD wallet with the Ethereum addresses that the merchant
uses on their end for executing PullPayments on the blockchain, for funding the PullPayment account addresses with ETH
to pay for gas and cashing out PMA and ETH to a treasury account on their end.
### Redis
Redis in-memory data structure store is used for storing information related to the PullPayment account address that will be executing the
PullPayment and for storing the maximum gas used for a PullPayment transaction.
